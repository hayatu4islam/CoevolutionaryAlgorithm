# CoevolutionaryAlgorithm
Like a genetic algorithm, but has creators and critics being assessed together

TODO:
==================
Improving algorithms to get more interesting results:
    - Move into HSV/HSLA so that progression of the AI can be better visualized
    - Make the critics do more than just compare to their ideal
    - Add pooling like in a CNN so it is less general randomness and potentially less intense computationally for larger scales
    - Add printing functions for showing all current critics/creators in the pool side-by-side

Fix github to track my commits right
